# Seakeeping Package

Based on programming experience, writing more detailed and expressive code for a specific field helps to improve the readability, maintainability, and descriptiveness of the code from the bottom.

Therefore, this package is formed to express and calculate the seakeeping problem of ships.

## Other packages

Here are other packages that are suitable for marine seakeeping issues:

- minpack: solve nonlinear equations;
- fftw/fftpack: Fast Fourier Transform;
- fgsl/gsl: general mathematical functions;
- toml-f: configuration file, terminal;
- M_CLI2: command line;
- openblas: linear algebra;
- test-drive: unit test;
- root-fortran: root lookup;
- polyroot-fortran: polynomial root search;
- Source Codes in Fortran90: Fortran 90 code.

In addition, there are analysis of CAE models and visualization of numerical models, and technical details such as function integration, statistics, sorting, special functions, etc.
